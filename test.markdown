The house at 175 Governor is in an R-3 zone, defined as follows:

> The R-3 Residential District is intended for higher density residential areas of detached single-family, two-family, and three-family residential development, as well as rowhouse development. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.

In the “Zoning Ordinance” in Section 1200 there is a “Use Matrix” for all zones, and in Section 1200.F.1 it says “any use that is not included in the use matrix is prohibited in all districts.” Table 12-1 lists the “principal and temporary” uses allowed in each type of zone, and in the column for R-3, none of the following are allowed: 

 - Contractor Storage Yard
 - Greenhouse/Nursery - Retail
 - Heavy Retail, Rental and Service
 - Industrial Design

There are two other potentially relevant uses in the table that require special permits:

 - Neighborhood Commercial Establishment
 - Plant Agriculture

All other “principal and temporary” uses are by definition prohibited in R-3.

The only acceptable “accessory uses” of a home in a residential zone are listed in Section 1302 (page 134). One of these is a “home occupation”, defined as “any activity customarily carried out for gain by a resident, conducted as an accessory use in the resident's dwelling unit.” The document lists several restrictions on such activity, of which the following are being violated by “Happy Feet” / “Eden Design”:

>(2) No more than one person is employed in the home occupation, other than an occupant or occupants of the premises. 
>
(3) Signs, displays, or activities that indicate from the exterior that the structure is being used, in part, for any purpose other than that of a residence are prohibited. However, one identification sign not exceeding two square feet in area is permitted. 
>
>(4) The home occupation and all related activity, including storage, shall be conducted completely within the principal building or permitted accessory structure. 
>
>(7) The home occupation and any related activity shall not create any traffic hazards or nuisances in public rights-of-way.

In Section 2100 on Enforcement (page 237), it says: 

>B.  The Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards has the power to conduct inspections of structures or the use of land to determine whether there is compliance with this Ordinance and, in case of any violation, order corrective action. 
>
>C.  The City Solicitor will institute an injunction, abatement, or any other appropriate action to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove such violation. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive and in addition to any other remedies provided by law. 
>
>D.  Any person or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, who violates or is the owner of property in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance will be fined up to $500.00 for each offense, with such fine to inure to the City. Each day of the existence of any violation is deemed a separate offense.

## Violations

### Business located in a residential zone

(show R-3 map, prop tax page showing R-3, fb post with map, letterhead, Richard prop tax, company photos)

On the company web site it says they serve “the East Side and Greater Providence”, but it does not give an address. On their Facebook page it shows “Governor St” as a vague location, but when you zoom in on the map, the GPS pin is dropped at 175 Governor. An invoice from “Eden Design by Mae” clearly shows the house is being used as the business address on their letterhead. 

Bizapedia.com shows “Eden Design by Mae” as an LLC with its principal address at 175 Governor Street, however “Eden Design” is not listed in the RI Secretary of State database for active businesses. “Happy Feet Lawn Care” is known to the state of RI as an LLC registered to Richard Benoit's current home address (as of 2020) in East Greenwich. 

On their Facebook page the companies categorize themselves as a “Garden Center”, “Business Service”, and “Architectural Designer”. 

### Multiple business employees in a home occupation

(show arrival/departure pix, employee facebook posts, license plate pix)

Every Monday through Saturday, from March through November (landscaping season), all the company employees report for work at 175 Governor around 7:30 am. There are generally 2 crews with 2 people each, who commute to work in their personal vehicles and leave them parked here all day. Each morning Ms. Warner meets the crews and gives them the daily schedule, then they load up the company trucks with equipment and supplies kept at her home, and the fleet drives off (usually including Ms. Warner) to do jobs for clients all day. The crews finish work around 3 to 4 pm, returning to the house to unload equipment and park the company trucks on the street overnight. They drop off the keys in the mailbox of 175 Governor, and then drive off in their personal vehicles. These same employees are shown and described on the company Facebook pages, dating back to 2017.

### Activity, signs, and storage outside the house indicating it is a business location

(show “fleet” pix, trucks with signs, license plates, busy days with load / unload)

The company operates a fleet of commercial vehicles and equipment, including 4 company pickups with attached signs, and 2 large 12-foot-long towed trailers. One trailer is a locked storage container for landscaping equipment, and one is open-sided for hauling debris (which is often parked full in front of neighboring houses). In addition, the company has a large variety of gasoline-powered equipment like leaf blowers, lawn mowers, edgers and trimmers, and snow blowers. The company’s equipment and supplies, including gasoline, fertilizer, mulch, and compost, are stored at the house and in the trailers. Three of the four company vehicles, and both trailers, are parked on the street illegally overnight every night at the intersection of Manning and Governor, in front of 175 Governor and neighboring homes.

### Business activity creating a traffic hazard or nuisance in public right-of-way
