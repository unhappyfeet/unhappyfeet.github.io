**Happy Feet Lawncare** and **Eden Design by Mae** are [landscape and lawn care contracting companies](http://happyfeetedendesign.com/) being run out of a personal residence at 175 Governor Street in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence (Ward 1, District 9), by the owner and resident Maebeth Warner.

These businesses are located in a residential R-3 zone, with significant daily activity involving 4 to 6 full-time employees, plus a fleet of 4 commercial vehicles with company signs that are parked at the intersection of Manning and Governor streets every day and night. The companies also operate trailers attached to 2 of the trucks, that serve as storage containers for their landscaping equipment, supplies, fuel, and debris.

This activity violates a number of city zoning and parking ordinances. The purpose of this site is to document the business activity and violations and bring them to the attention of city officials.
