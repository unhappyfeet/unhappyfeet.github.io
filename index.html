<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Happy Feet Lawncare” and “Eden Design by Mae” are <a
href="http://happyfeetedendesign.com/">landscape and lawn care contracting
companies</a> being run illegally out of a personal residence at 175 Governor Street
in the College Hill neighborhood (Ward 1, District 9), by the owner and
resident Maebeth Warner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These businesses are located in a residential R-3 zone, with
significant daily activity involving 4 to 6 full-time employees, plus a fleet
of 4 commercial vehicles with company signs that are parked illegally at the
intersection of Manning and Governor streets every day and night. The companies
also operate trailers attached to 2 of the trucks, that serve as storage
containers for their landscaping equipment, supplies, fuel, and debris.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These activities violate many different city zoning and
parking regulations, detailed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>ZONING VIOLATIONS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The house at 175 Governor is in an R-3 zone, defined as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:34.1pt;margin-left:.25in'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"ArialMT",serif'>The R-3 Residential
District is intended for higher density residential areas of detached
single-family, two-family, and three-family residential development, as well as
rowhouse development. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with
surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the “Zoning Ordinance” in Section 1200 there is a “Use
Matrix” for all zones, and in Section 1200.F.1 it says “any use that is not
included in the use matrix is prohibited in all districts.” Table 12-1 lists
the “principal and temporary” uses allowed in each type of zone, and in the
column for R-3, none of the following are allowed: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two other potentially relevant uses in the table
that require special permits:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All other “principal and temporary” uses are by definition
prohibited in R-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only acceptable “accessory uses” of a home in a
residential zone are listed in Section 1302 (page 134). One of these is a “home
occupation”, defined as “any activity customarily carried out for gain by a
resident, conducted as an accessory use in the resident's dwelling unit.” The
document lists several restrictions on such activity, of which the following
are being violated by “Happy Feet” / “Eden Design”:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every Monday through Saturday, from March through November
(landscaping season), all the company employees report for work at 175 Governor
around 7:30 am. There are generally 2 crews with 2 people each, who commute to
work in their personal vehicles and leave them parked here all day. Each morning
Ms. Warner meets the crews and gives them the daily schedule, then they load up
the company trucks with equipment and supplies kept at her home, and the fleet
drives off (usually including Ms. Warner) to do jobs for clients all day. The
crews finish work around 3 to 4 pm, returning to the house to unload equipment
and park the company trucks on the street overnight. They drop off the keys in
the mailbox of 175 Governor, and then drive off in their personal vehicles. These
same employees are shown and described on the company Facebook pages, dating
back to 2017.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company operates a fleet of commercial vehicles and
equipment, including 4 company pickups with attached signs, and 2 large
12-foot-long towed trailers. One trailer is a locked storage container for
landscaping equipment, and one is open-sided for hauling debris (which is often
parked full in front of neighboring houses). In addition, the company has a
large variety of gasoline-powered equipment like leaf blowers, lawn mowers, edgers
and trimmers, and snow blowers. The company’s equipment and supplies, including
gasoline, fertilizer, mulch, and compost, are stored at the house and in the trailers.
Three of the four company vehicles, and both trailers, are parked on the street
illegally overnight every night at the intersection of Manning and Governor, in
front of 175 Governor and neighboring homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Overnight Parking document it says no vehicle can be
parked on the street overnight in Resident Permit Parking Areas without a
permit. Here is the <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/efile/2658.pdf">city

both Resident Permit Parking Areas. Vehicles must display their permits in
these areas or be ticketed, as described in Section III.E.d:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fine for illegal overnight&nbsp;street parking&nbsp;is
$20 per violation, with ticketing between 2 am and 5 am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The section regarding “Eligibility” for an overnight permit
in Section III.C.g (page 3) says:</p>

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a private car stored in the front yard of 175
Governor, next to the property line with 165 Governor. The residents of 175
Governor painted the city street curb yellow to treat it as a second driveway and
prevent street parking that would block it. But this is not a legal curb cut, the
house has a driveway on the other side next to 181 Governor. The property owner
even placed a row of bricks in the city street gutter to make it easier for the
car to hop the curb. But the car is now just stored there in the yard, on a
brick walkway, and has not moved in over a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following 4 trucks and 2 trailers are used by the
businesses and have company signs prominently displayed on their side panels:</p>

Chevy Silverado 1500 -- license 38267, sign “Happy Feet Lawncare”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the trucks are all the same model, the Chevy Silverado
1500, which according to <a
href="https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/silverado/1500/build-and-price/features/trims/table?section=Mechanical&amp;section=Dimensions&amp;styleOne=413044">Chevy’s
specs</a> is minimum 7000GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight). This GVW rating classifies
all the trucks as “commercial vehicles” according to city code 15-11(a),
because they are over the 6500GVW limit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commercial vehicles are not allowed to park in a residential
zone, except when loading / unloading goods for customers, and that is not the
case here -- “Happy Feet” / “Eden Design” are service businesses. In addition,
none of these commercial vehicles are eligible to receive overnight parking permits.
So they should all be ticketed any time they are parked on Governor or Manning
streets.</p>
